CODE README:
============

- The code is written with Unity 4.3.3f1
- Scripts/Dialog contains the code for the dialog logic (which is only used in the first room)
- Scripts/HUD contains the code for the menu bar which is shown in the individual rooms. 
- Scripts/Hallway contains the code for the hallway shown at the beginning. It is heavily inspired by the unity 2D tutorial (the tutorial with the walking potatoe)
- To start the game from within the unity editor, select the Loader scene as the first scene of the game.
- In general, the code is very messy and contains outdated stuff. Don't expect readability.
